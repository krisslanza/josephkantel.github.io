Each opponent requires an image set and an HTML dialogue (gotta stop using the word speech) and behaviour file.

All images should be ".jpg" named as outlined below. Might expand the image types later.
The HTML file should be "behaviour.html".


Each state of dress is referred to as a 'stage', with the number of the stage being the number of articles of clothing removed. Each expression within a stage is called a 'state'.

In the behaviour file, whenever a certain case happens, it will outline the state of the opponent. This will be used to determine what image should be displayed. For instance, if they lose an article of clothing they might enter the 'embrassed' state, which would corresspond to an image of them embarrased in their current state of dress.

The images for a stage must all begin with the name and number of the stage followed by the name of the state the character is in. Therefore, the names of the image would be something like:

stage1calm.jpg
stage1nervous.jpg
stage1happy.jpg
stage1angry.jpg
stage1sad.jpg
stage1embrassed.jpg
stage1horny.jpg


There also needs to be a starting image, which will be predfined in the behaviour.html file of the opponent, along with transition images between each state of dress. None of this has been implemented yet, but it will be.
